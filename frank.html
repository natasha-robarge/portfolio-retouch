      <h3>What is Frank?</h3>

      <section class="container">
        <p>Frank is our solution to commerical electricity. Frank lets you know
           how much your fixed electric contract is saving you, when your contract is due,
           and whether or not you have any cancellation fees due. It's the only platform
           that can deliver insights on your usage and billing. Frank also offers you
           ways to sell back electricity back to the grid that you're not using to save even more.</p>

        <p>Nommad is our solution to finding food trucks near you. Nommad shows
           you all food trucks within a 10 mile radius of the zip code you enter.

      <h3 class="switch-direction">First Thoughts On The Project</h3>

      <section class="container-switch">
        <p>This was my second group project at General Assembly. I wasn't very hyped about
           our project, but it still came out well in the end. I tried working with the front end
           for this project, but near the end of the project, I realized that designing really wasn't
           my strong suit so I ended up helping out a bit with the functionality which was similar to
           the functionality I did with our first group projects.</p>

      <h3>Obstacles</h3>

      <section class="container">
        <p>I ended up having to overcome many obstacles while working on this project.
           Usually the obstacles that I had to overcome were things like bad documentation or not enough information on a bug.
           Part of the time, it was me trying to understand a bad implementation of a wireframe I had received that wasn't user friendly.
           I also had to do a lot of logical thinking for the chat support screen. The chat support screen was supposed to be
           a short showcase on how it would be used. I had to think of a way to create an AI that responds to users and their
           questions about Frank. Interestingly enough, the hardest part for me was figuring out how to get a chart to appear
           on the screen. I looked for a package that would make a chart if it's given data and the best thing I ended up finding
           was a package called "victory-native". After trying to understand the documentation and going through tricky manual installations,
           I found a forum of people who use victory-native. That was the hardest part. </p>

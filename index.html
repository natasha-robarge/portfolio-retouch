      <h1>About me</h1>
      <hr id="line-rule">
      <p>I am the protagonist of a video game who is passionate and determined.
        I am a programmer who aspires to learn more about the field and how I
        can contribute in a meaningful way and help others. As a humanitarian,
        I want to help society and I will do that through coding; whether that
        means creating an informative website to teach people about different
        topics or by developing a video game for people to play after a
        hard day. If it can help someone somehow, I'm in.</p>

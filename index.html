        <h3>More About Me</h3>
        <hr id="line-rule" />

        <p>Throughout high school I had a plan and I was going to stick to it.
           My plan was to go to Hack Reactor, becoming a coding bootcamp student,
           get a job, and then go to college for a computer science major part-time while
           working full-time. I ended up failing my first technical interview with Hack Reactor,
           so I ended up taking their Web Development prep course that they claimed would help with
           the technical interview. I took that course in April of 2017, while going to school during
           the day since it was a month before I would graduate. I didn't feel prepared after the course,
           but I still took the technical interview and I took another one of their prep courses that was new.
           This one was their "Structured Study Program". After the course, I did another technical interview.
           I failed again. I retook that course, and when I finished the course and went in for another technical interview,
           I wasn't surprised when I was told for the fourth time that I had failed. I didn't want to give up on being a developer.
           I didn't care that I failed because I wanted to go on with the plan I had mapped out when I was 16.
           I went to another coding bootcamp to see the atmosphere and whether or not I liked it. They didn't even give me
           an interview- they just told me I was too young to be in a coding bootcamp.
           I had hope that I would find a place that would accept me. That hope lead me to General Assembly,
           where I started my career as a software developer. It was the best thing that I never want to do again until 10 or 20
           years from now because technology is constantly changing and I want to keep learning as much as I can.
           I have resiliance. I have determination. I have hope. Most importantly,
           I'm self-disciplined and I will be the best person I can be in life no matter how many times I fail.

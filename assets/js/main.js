console.log("Hey, thanks for looking through the code. This site is still needing feedback and I'm still working on it so if you have any feedback, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I convinced a UX designer to help me out with my portfolio and if you'd like me to direct her to you, I can do so because she's currently up for hire as well. ");

console.log("Now since you made it this far, let me give you more of a background about me. I'm really proud to say that I made it this far. I'm 19, a part-time Teaching Assistant at UT's Coding Bootcamp, a double major undergraduate student, and a coding bootcamp graduate. I'm extremely proud of how far I've come because I had imposter syndrome every step of the way getting to where I am now. I didn't think I could do it, but here I am, gaining as much experience as possible, and meeting the most inspiring people I've ever met. Seriously. I met this guy at a networking event, and I don't think I've met anyone that had amazed me as this guy had- yet. He taught himself how to code but he didn't go through a coding bootcamp- he actually did the smartest thing I've heard. He learned how to code and got a job by looking at the curriculum of different coding bootcamps, and tailoring his own journey by teaching himself the languages they had on the syllabus. ");
console.log("----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
console.log("I had been amazed. I feel like this guy should be working at Google, because I feel like people don't usually think about things like that. Then again, people also don't think about Ethics in Tech often, or ask what companies are using user data for. 'How we can get more women/LGBTQA/diversity/(enter whatever here) in tech' I hear professionals ask. How about giving people who want to get into tech a chance? Why not start with the self-taught and underrepresented people who have a dream- to do what they feel they cannot do even though they did it. Instead of condescending coding bootcamp graduates, why can't we congratulate them for making something in a week, and learning framework after framework- language after language in such a short amount of time? Instead of judging people who have a Master's Degree or a PHD in Computer Science, why can't we just learn from their knowledge? Let's applaud them for pushing themselves to the max and for doing their best.");
console.log("----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
console.log("I have mentored people in tech events, and every student, co-worker, or tech person I've met has impacted me. I'm so proud of the students I've had, and the new students and co-workers I'll meet because they have inspired me so much. I see them working so hard all the time to understand concepts, and be the best they can be. They've inspired me to want to lead them in their journey, and start a technical interview prep meetup where we can get together, and bring each other up from the obstacles we face. This is who I am. I am passionate. I'm so passionate that I think I just ranted in a console log- hahaha. Yet, I ranted about the important things that aren't discussed often. We're all human. We all make mistakes. However, we can learn from each other, improve ourselves, and change. I believe anyone can do what they put their mind to. They just need a push to get them to run and finally catch a bouquet of dreams.")

console.log("I'm done ranting now, so I'll let you continue to look over the code. Congrats on making it this far into my portfolio!");
